Entrepreneurship & Building
Distribution beats product, almost every time.

Nobody cares about your idea until you make it real.

Beta > Stealth mode. Ship embarrassingly early.

A warm intro is 10x better than a cold email.

Speed is a moat when you’re small.

If people don’t pay, they don’t value it.

Founding teams crumble more from ego than failure.

Iterate on who you build for, as much as what you build.

It’s easier to sell aspirin than vitamins (solve pain, not “nice-to-haves”).

Scarcity and exclusivity sell better than abundance.

Learning & Career
Learning fast > knowing a lot.

Side projects open more doors than resumes.

Being interesting beats being impressive.

Document your work publicly; opportunities will find you.

The best way to learn is to teach.

Talking to users/customers teaches more than any course.

You’re not behind. Most people are faking it.

Compound skills, not just knowledge (writing + coding + marketing? lethal).

People remember your curiosity, not your GPA.

You learn faster around ambitious people. Proximity is underrated.

Leadership & Teamwork
People follow energy, not titles.

Delegate outcomes, not tasks.

Praise in public, correct in private.

Hire for drive and learning ability, not just credentials.

Culture is set by what you tolerate, not what you say.

Feedback is a gift—if you make it safe to give.

Small teams move faster but require over-communication.

It’s okay to outgrow people (and vice versa).

Marketing & Communication
Clarity wins over cleverness.

Storytelling makes facts stick.

If you confuse, you lose.

Attention is earned, not owed.

Copywriting is an unfair advantage.

Write how you talk. People like humans, not robots.

A clear CTA beats a beautiful design.

Your personal brand compounds like startup equity.

Mindset & Personal Growth
Consistency is rarer than talent.

Most people quit too soon. Just stay in the game longer.

Obsession looks like talent from the outside.

Take big swings while you’re young and broke—risk is cheaper.

You can’t outwork a bad system—optimize environment too.

Confidence comes from keeping promises to yourself.

If you don’t ask, the answer is always no.

Build things that make you proud, even if no one claps.

Protect your energy like it’s equity.

Life & Misc (the cool ones)
Being kind is a cheat code in any industry.

People remember how you made them feel, not what you said.

The fastest way to level up is to help people who don’t expect it.

Most things are figureoutable (but Googling well is a skill).

Have strong opinions, loosely held.
